The presentation is in [slides](./slides) in various formats.

The small code examples from the presentation are in [code](./code). To run the code examples download [the Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) (which includes everything you need to get started with Haskell), cd to code, type 'ghci', and then ':l filename.hs'.
I also used some source from [blackjack-simulator](https://github.com/tjakway/blackjack-simulator), particularly:

    *  [card data declarations](https://github.com/tjakway/blackjack-simulator/blob/master/src/Jakway/Blackjack/Cards.hs).
    * [infinite shuffled deck of cards](https://github.com/tjakway/blackjack-simulator/blob/master/src/Jakway/Blackjack/CardOps.hs).
    * You can also see more IO examples (if you heard the monad part of the talk at the end) in [the database source.](https://github.com/tjakway/blackjack-simulator/tree/master/src/Jakway/Blackjack/IO).
